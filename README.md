# Create HACKERRANK Challenge with Automation

The project automates the process of creating `HackerRank` challenges using `Puppeteer` and Node.js.

It utilizes the concept of `promises` to make the code asynchronous.

## Working üìù

- We have a object file which contains different problems as objects.
- With the help of Node.js we automate the process of creating challenge.
- It select problems from object file one by one and add those as challenges in hackerrank.
- It also add moderator name in the challenges.
- The project has the potential to save time and resources for organizations that frequently use HackerRank for hiring and skill assessments.
